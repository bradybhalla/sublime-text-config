# sublime-text-config

This is my Sublime Text config from when I used it as my main editor. I have now simplified it greatly.

## Setup Instructions
1) Move the contents of this repository to the `User` folder.  On macOS, this is probably located at `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text/Packages/User`.
2) Open the command palette (`Cmd + Shift + P`) and type `Install Package Control` if Package Control is not already installed.
3) Restart Sublime Text.

Note: This will overwrite the current preferences and packages.

## Configuration

### Syntax specific configs
#### LaTeX
- "LaTeX" build system to compile and view pdf
  - Uses `pdflatex`
- Keybinds to make writing more natural ([LaTeX/Default.sublime-keymap](LaTeX/Default.sublime-keymap))
- Additional snippets ([LaTeX/Snippets](LaTeX/Snippets))

#### Markdown
- "Markdown" build system to compile and view HTML
  - Uses `pandoc` (installed with Homebrew)
  - Nicely styled page
  - Code can be copied by clicking
  - Deletes HTML after build
- Color scheme to make headers more visible
