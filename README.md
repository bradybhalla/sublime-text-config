# sublime-text-config

My minimal Sublime Text config now that I no longer use it as my main editor.  Check the [old-config branch](/bradybhalla/sublime-text-config/tree/old-config) to see my old config.

## Setup Instructions
1) Move the contents of this repository to the `User` folder.  On macOS, this is probably located at `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text/Packages/User`.
2) Open the command palette (`Cmd + Shift + P`) and type `Install Package Control` if Package Control is not already installed.
3) Restart Sublime Text.

Note: This will overwrite the current preferences and packages.

## Configuration

Essentially just a few packages (see [Package Control.sublime-settings](Package%20Control.sublime-settings)) and shortcuts (see [Default (OSX).sublime-keymap](Default%20(OSX).sublime-keymap)).
